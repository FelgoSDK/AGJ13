Locomotive Breath is a multitouch tablet game which is playable in singleplayer or co-op mode.
Aim of the game is to drive a steam locomotive by regulating the velocity and switching the rails to avoid colissions with moose standing around. The player is able to switch the rails with a finger-swipe up or down on the labeled rails.

In case of a co-op game the second player is asked to shovel coals or release steam with the pipe to keep the preasure in the green field.
Aditionally, the steam pipe helps to chase away moose standing on your lane but this only works with enough steam in the boiler.

We choosed the snow scenery with moose, because of the nordish problem with them standing on railway lanes, when the snow around is to much.
